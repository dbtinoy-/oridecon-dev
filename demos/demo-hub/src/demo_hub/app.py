"""Composition root for the demo hub — start reading here.

Every Lexigram application has exactly one place that knows how the pieces
fit together: the **composition root**.  Everything else (controllers,
services, templates) is inert until *this file* wires it.

The mental model has three layers.  Once these click, every Lexigram app
reads the same way:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. CONFIGURATION                                                        │
│    ``application.yaml`` holds your values.  The framework loads it,     │
│    merges overrides on top (highest → lowest):                          │
│                                                                         │
│        LEX_WEB__SERVER__PORT=9000   env vars   ← win over everything    │
│        application.production.yaml  profile overlay                     │
│        application.yaml             base file                           │
│        dataclass field defaults     last resort                         │
│                                                                         │
│    Result: ONE typed ``LexigramConfig`` object.                         │
│                                                                         │
│ 2. CAPABILITIES (declarative)                                           │
│    ``Module.configure(...)`` switches framework packages on and tells   │
│    them which controllers are yours.  Each package reads its own yaml   │
│    section through its config model.                                    │
│                                                                         │
│ 3. SERVICES (imperative)                                               │
│    A ``Provider`` registers the services *you* wrote into the DI        │
│    container, with register/boot/shutdown lifecycle hooks.              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Two wiring styles are supported everywhere; both produce identical
runtime behavior:

- **Explicit** (this file): sections passed to ``configure(config=...)``
  make the wiring visible and testable at the composition root.
- **Automatic**: call ``configure()`` with no arguments — providers declare
  ``config_key``/``config_model``, so the orchestrator injects their typed
  section from the loaded config before boot.

Unknown/typo keys (``prot:`` vs ``port:``) fail startup with a
did-you-mean suggestion instead of silently falling back to defaults.

The hub is a **meta-demo**: it boots every web demo's real Lexigram
``Application`` in-process and mounts it under ``/demos/<slug>/``.
The ``Fleet`` service handles child mounting; this file wires the hub
itself.
