"""Read model and notification handlers for the event-driven orders demo.

These live on the **read side**: they consume published domain events and
project them into a query-friendly view. They never dispatch commands — the
write side stays authoritative.

Two handler types:

1. ``OrdersView`` — projection that builds the query-side order view.
   Each event handler updates the read model in place.  The view is
   what the REST API returns for ``GET /orders``.

2. ``NotificationHandler`` — side-effect handler that logs customer
   notifications (emails, webhooks).  In production, this would call
   an email service or message queue.

Convention: event handlers are named ``on_<event_type>`` and receive the
event as their sole argument.  The event bus dispatches events to all
subscribers by event type.
