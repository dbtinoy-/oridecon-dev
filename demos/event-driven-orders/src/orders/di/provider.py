"""DI wiring for the event-driven orders demo — Provider lifecycle pattern.

A Provider tells the DI container *what* exists and *how* to build it.
Two-phase lifecycle: ``register()`` binds, ``boot()`` initializes.

Simplest patterns for new users:

- ``container.singleton(Thing, instance=Thing())`` — already built, hand it over
- ``container.singleton(Thing, factory=lambda: ...)`` — build lazily on first resolve
- ``container.singleton(Thing, factory=self._build_thing)`` — async factory for complex wiring

This demo wires the **CQRS write side** (repository, command handlers, outbox)
and the **read side** (projection, notifications) onto the framework's
in-memory command and event buses.  All handlers are constructor-injected
services — no service locator.

Convention: one Provider per bounded context; ``register()`` does binding
(no I/O), ``boot()`` does initialization (I/O allowed).
