"""Composition root for the event-driven orders demo — start reading here.

Every Lexigram application has exactly one place that knows how the pieces
fit together: the **composition root**.  Everything else (controllers,
services, templates) is inert until *this file* wires it.

The mental model has three layers.  Once these click, every Lexigram app
reads the same way:

1. CONFIGURATION — ``application.yaml`` holds your values.  The framework
   loads it; ``LEX_*`` env vars win over yaml.

2. CAPABILITIES (declarative) — ``Module.configure(...)`` switches
   framework packages on.  Each reads its own yaml section automatically.

3. SERVICES (imperative) — a ``Provider`` registers the services *you*
   wrote into the DI container.

This demo's lesson is the **CQRS + outbox** pattern: commands flow through
the command bus, handlers persist state and stage domain events in the
outbox, and the outbox relay delivers events to read-side projections and
notification handlers.  The REST surface and browser UI drive the same
``OrdersApi`` facade.

Run with::

    cd demos/event-driven-orders
    PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m orders

# Lexigram composition root — the single file that wires
# all modules and providers together. Your app will have exactly one
# composition root. Framework modules (EventsModule, WebModule) are
# declarative; your app-specific Provider is imperative.
