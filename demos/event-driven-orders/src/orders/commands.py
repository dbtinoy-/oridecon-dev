"""Commands for the event-driven orders demo.

Commands are frozen dataclasses extending the framework's
:class:`~lexigram.events.messages.Command`. Each command targets a handler on
the command bus; handlers mutate the write-side state and publish domain
events afterwards (CQRS write path).

Commands are **intent objects** — they describe what the caller wants, not how
to do it.  The command bus routes each command type to exactly one handler.

Convention: ``@dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True)`` for immutable
command objects; ``Command`` base from lexigram.events.messages.
