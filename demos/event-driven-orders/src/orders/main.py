"""Standalone server entry point for the event-driven orders demo.

Run::

    cd demos/event-driven-orders
    PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m orders

Host/port come from ``application.yaml`` — no hardcoded values.
The order lifecycle walkthrough is available from the browser console.

Lifecycle teaching notes:
- ``Application.start()`` boots every provider in dependency order,
  freezes the container, and yields a fully-wired application.
- Resolving ``WebProvider`` after start demonstrates post-start
  resolution; its auto-injected ``.config`` carries the server host/port.
- The ``OrdersProvider.boot()`` resolves ``OrdersApi``, which triggers
  handler and event-subscription wiring exactly once (singleton factory).
