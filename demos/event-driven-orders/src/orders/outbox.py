"""Outbox for the event-driven orders demo.

A minimal in-memory transactional-outbox pattern: command handlers stage the
domain event they will publish, and the outbox tracks it until it is flushed
(here: re-published through the event bus, or reported). In a real deployment
the outbox rows live in the same transaction as the write-side state; this
demo keeps the shape of that pattern without a database.
