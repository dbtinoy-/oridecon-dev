"""Persona directory — role-keyed seeded users for the console.

Lexigram convention: ``domain/`` holds framework-agnostic models and
services.  This catalog is plain Python — no framework imports.

Three personas ship with the demo — ``viewer``, ``editor``, ``admin`` —
one per RBAC tier, so every row of the permission matrix can be exercised
by logging in as a different user (see ``data/seed.py`` for how they're
created and ``tests/test_rbac.py`` for the login helper).

Teaching note: personas are *demo scaffolding*, not a framework concept.
In a real app your users come from a database or an identity provider;
the rest of this demo never imports this module except to render the
persona picker.
