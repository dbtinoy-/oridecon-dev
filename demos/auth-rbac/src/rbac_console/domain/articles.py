"""The protected resource — an in-memory article store.

Lexigram convention: ``domain/`` holds framework-agnostic models and
services.  No framework imports here — just plain dataclasses.  The DI
container treats them like any other service (see ``di/provider.py``),
and swapping this in-memory implementation for Postgres later changes
nothing outside ``di/``.

The RBAC demo needs something to guard.  Articles are the resource every
persona tries to read/create/delete; the permission matrix in
``controllers/api.py`` is exercised entirely against this store.

Deliberately *not* here: authorization checks.  Stores stay dumb —
controllers ask ``AuthorizationService`` before touching them.
