"""Pytest bootstrap for the realtime-monitor demo.

Two jobs:

1. Make imports and config discovery work regardless of *where* pytest is
   invoked: chdir into this demo's root (where ``application.yaml`` lives)
   and put ``src`` on ``sys.path``. The framework auto-discovers
   ``application.yaml`` from the working directory, so after this chdir no
   custom configuration loader is needed anywhere.
2. Re-pin cwd before every test so parallel or fixture-driven cwd changes
   never break yaml discovery.

    uv run pytest demos/realtime-monitor/tests -q        # from repo root works too
