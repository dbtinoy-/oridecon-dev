"""DI wiring for the MFA console demo.

A Provider tells the DI container *what* exists and *how* to build it.
Two-phase lifecycle: ``register()`` binds, ``boot()`` initializes.

Simplest patterns for new users:

- ``container.singleton(Thing, instance=Thing())`` — already built, hand it over
- ``container.singleton(Thing, factory=lambda: ...)`` — build lazily on first resolve
- ``container.singleton(Thing, factory=self._build_thing)`` — async factory for complex wiring

Don't re-register framework keys (e.g. ``AuthenticationService``) — the
auth bundle already owns them.
