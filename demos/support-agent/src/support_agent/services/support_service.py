"""Agent construction and the API-facing facade.

This module has two jobs:

1. **Agent assembly** — ``build_support_agent()`` uses the framework's
   ``AgentBuilder`` to declare the agent's name, system prompt, tools,
   and strategy.  The builder produces an ``AgentProtocol`` — a pure
   data object with no I/O.

2. **Facade** — ``SupportAgent`` wraps the executor and agent into a
   single ``ask()`` method that the controller calls.  It records the
   last response for debugging and logs token/timing metadata.

The agent uses the **ReAct** strategy: the LLM emits
``THOUGHT / ACTION / ACTION_INPUT / FINAL_ANSWER`` markers that the
strategy parser drives in a loop, calling tools between steps.
