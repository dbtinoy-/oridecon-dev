"""Deterministic scenario scripts driving the scripted LLM.

The ReAct strategy parses ``THOUGHT / ACTION / ACTION_INPUT`` markers
from the LLM's completion text and terminates on ``FINAL_ANSWER``.
Each scenario is a list of pre-written completions — one per reasoning
step — that the ``ScriptedLLM`` pops from a FIFO queue.

This makes the agent loop run for real (tools get called, the strategy
parser drives the loop) while model output stays byte-stable across
runs — perfect for testing and demos.
