"""Pure, offline tools the support agent calls during ReAct loops.

Tools are the bridge between the agent's reasoning and the real world.
Each tool is a plain async function with typed parameters — the framework's
``@tool`` decorator wraps it into a ``FunctionTool`` that the agent
strategy can invoke by name.

This demo ships three tools:

- ``lookup_order`` — fetch order details from the in-memory store
- ``calculate_refund`` — apply the tiered refund policy
- ``search_kb`` — keyword-match against the FAQ knowledge base

The ``SUPPORT_TOOLS`` registry is a ``Registry[str, Any]`` keyed by tool
name.  ``build_support_agent()`` in ``support_service.py`` unpacks these
into the agent builder.
