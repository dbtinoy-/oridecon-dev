# 02 — Improvement Roadmap: Professional-Grade lexigram-admin

Goal: take lexigram-admin from "feature-rich but rough on first contact" to
a tool an operator can install, boot, and trust in production without
reading source code. Items are ordered by leverage; each lists intent,
approach, and acceptance criteria so any contributor can pick one up.

Phases are sequenced so that every phase leaves the product strictly better
and shippable — no phase depends on a later one.

---

## Phase 1 — First-contact excellence (mostly DONE 2026-09-01)

The first 15 minutes decide whether a team adopts an admin framework.

- **R1. One-call bootstrap — DONE.** `create_app()` now returns a working,
  mounted app with sane SQLite defaults; `container=`/`database_url=`
  escape hatches for real deployments. The CLI's `lexigram dev` command
  provides the documented auto-detected development-server path; the admin
  package remains usable without installing the optional CLI package.
- **R2. Un-brickable first run — DONE.** Setup-token-verified first admin
  (B3), truthful setup outcome on all drivers (B8), super-admin actually
  super (B1/B2). *Acceptance:* fresh DB → setup → login → CRUD with all
  defaults, zero config beyond a session secret and setup token — verified
  live, keep a scenario test guarding it (see R5).
- **R3. Self-contained frontend — DONE.** All shell/standalone assets served
  from the admin's static mount, pinned (B6). Trix is vendored; optional
  chart renderers remain explicitly configurable because they are not loaded
  by the default shell (see doc 03's optional-asset note).

## Phase 2 — Trust: errors, observability, coherence

- **R4. Friendly-error discipline — DONE (2026-09-01).** Shared
  `controllers/_errors.py::humanize_error()` strips `[LEX_ERR_*]` codes and
  `→ Fix:`/`→ See:` annotations **anywhere** in chained messages (the old
  helper only handled a leading prefix); `_humanize_error` in auth/core now
  delegates to it. The last raw-exception render (setup wizard's
  "Failed to create account: {exc}") is humanized with the full detail
  logged first. Tests: `tests/unit/controllers/test_error_humanizer.py`.
  *Standing rule:* controllers route ALL user-facing error text through
  `humanize_error` or use fixed messages, and log the raw error first.
- **R5. First-run scenario test — DONE (2026-09-01).**
  `tests/e2e/test_first_run_scenario_e2e.py` boots `create_app()` on real
  SQL stores (temp SQLite, default security settings) and walks
  setup → login → dashboard → list → create → edit → logout, plus a
  second-submission lockout scenario. Every page is checked for hygiene
  (single title, no CDN refs, no `LEX_ERR` leaks). Guards B1–B8.
- **R8. Silence expected contributor failures at boot — DONE (2026-09-01).**
  Two layers: the admin contributor sub-provider now catches
  `UnresolvableDependencyError` from `on_admin_boot` and logs a one-line
  `admin.contributor_disabled` INFO (tracebacks reserved for genuine
  faults); the webhook contributor does the same on its own resolve path
  (`webhook.admin_contributor_disabled`). Verified: playground boot log now
  contains **zero** tracebacks. *Follow-up:* other contributors
  (web/cache/auth/events/queue) still log multi-line LEX_ERR text in their
  single-line warnings — normalize to the same terse pattern.
- **R6. Unify the permission scheme — DONE (2026-09-01).** New canonical
  module `auth/permission_scheme.py`: `.view/.create/.update/.delete` are
  canonical; `.read`/`.list` (→ view) and `.edit` (→ update) are deprecated
  aliases. All three former ad-hoc variants now derive from it: sidebar nav
  inference (`ui/templates/shell_sections.py`), list-renderer capabilities
  (`resources/list_renderer.py`), and the request boundary
  (`middleware/authorization.py`, which now honours aliases via the
  service's `can_execute_action` — closing the old inconsistency where a
  `.read` holder saw the nav link but got 403). An alias-only grant logs a
  one-line `admin_authz.legacy_permission_grant` deprecation warning (once
  per resource/alias per process); aliases will be dropped in a future
  minor version. Tests:
  `tests/unit/middleware/test_permission_scheme.py` (12).
- **R7. Content-negotiated error responses — DONE (2026-09-01).** New shared
  helper `middleware/_negotiation.py` (status→title/message/icon metadata,
  `prefers_html()`, `styled_error_response()`). `AdminErrorMiddleware` now
  also inspects *responses* from `call_next`: bare non-HTML 403/404/405/500
  (e.g. Starlette's plain-text router 404/405) are upgraded to the styled
  error page for browser navigations, while JSON callers and HTMX fragment
  swaps keep machine-readable responses.
  `AdminAuthorizationMiddleware._forbidden` negotiates too: styled 403 page
  for browsers, `HX-Trigger` toast for HTMX, JSON for APIs. Tests:
  `tests/unit/middleware/test_error_negotiation.py` (16). Verified live:
  `/admin/nonexistent` renders "Page Not Found" with a dashboard link in a
  browser and stays machine-readable for `Accept: application/json`.
- **R9. De-duplicate log emission — DONE (2026-09-01).** Every
  INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE was logged twice: `DatabaseOperationContext.__aexit__`
  (lexigram-sql `crud_operations.py`) emitted its own query-log entry while
  the inner `QueryExecutor.execute_modify` also logged the same statement in
  its `finally`. The context manager no longer logs — the query executor is
  the single source of query-log emission; the context keeps connection
  lifecycle, timing, and `DatabaseError` normalisation. Regression tests:
  `packages/lexigram-sql/tests/unit/test_query_log_single_emission.py`
  (one entry per INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/SELECT, including the failure path).
  Verified live: audit-log INSERT lines now appear exactly once at boot.

## Phase 3 — Operator-facing functionality

- **R10. Roles & permissions UI.** ✅ **Done 2026-09-01** — shipped as two
  superadmin-only controllers (`/admin/roles`, `/admin/users`): role
  list/create/edit/delete with a per-resource permission checkbox matrix
  (live `PermissionInventoryService` options + validated custom entries),
  user listing with role assignment. Guard rails: last-superadmin demotion
  rejected fail-closed, held roles cannot be deleted, system roles protected;
  every change audited with actor attribution (`user_roles_updated` +
  attributed `role_created/updated/deleted`). Fixed framework bug B11
  (route path params dropped) en route. Full plan and phase 2/3 follow-ups
  in [06-access-control-ui.md](06-access-control-ui.md).
- **R11. Mailer onboarding.** ✅ **Done 2026-09-01** — shipped as the
  Email delivery page (`/admin/email`, superadmin-only): runtime status
  card (backend, sender identity, remediation guidance when unbound) and
  a one-click test email to the acting admin's own address. Debug mode
  now auto-registers a log-only `AdminConsoleMailer` fallback when no
  `MailerProtocol` is bound (never in production, never overriding a real
  backend), so verification/reset/OTP flows are completable from the
  server log in development. Full plan and phase 2/3 follow-ups in
  [07-mailer-onboarding.md](07-mailer-onboarding.md).
- **R12. Session & security dashboard.** ✅ **Done 2026-09-01** — shipped
  as the Security Center (`/admin/security`, superadmin-only): fleet-wide
  active-sessions view with remote revoke, filterable audit-log browser,
  lockout lookup + manual unlock, all audited. Full plan and phase 2/3
  follow-ups in [05-security-center.md](05-security-center.md).
- **R13. Saved views & filter presets.** ✅ **Done 2026-09-02** — per-user
  named list views (search, filters, sort, per-page, view/layout/density,
  grouping, hidden columns) stored via the settings service (no
  migration); views bar on every resource list page with one-click apply,
  save-current-view, delete, and active-view highlighting. Full plan and
  follow-ups (shared views, default view) in
  [08-saved-views.md](08-saved-views.md).
- **R14. Bulk-action UX hardening.** ✅ **Done 2026-09-02; phase 2
  implemented 2026-09-03** — per-row outcome accounting for bulk
  delete/purge/restore: honest toasts ("Deleted 47 of 50 item(s) - 3 failed:
  …") with severity success/warning/error, row-failure isolation (one bad
  row no longer aborts the batch or mis-reports completed work), the silent
  bulk-purge no-op fixed to a proper 503, and thresholded live progress for
  large HTMX mutations through owner-bound SSE/status streams. Short and
  unsupported requests remain synchronous. Playground/browser verification is
  intentionally deferred. Full plans in [09-bulk-ux.md](09-bulk-ux.md) and
  [53-bulk-live-progress.md](53-bulk-live-progress.md).
- **Security headers wired.** ✅ **Done 2026-09-02** — the orphaned
  `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` (flagged in doc 01) now sits outermost in the
  admin stack, so every response carries the OWASP set (HSTS, CSP,
  X-Frame-Options, nosniff, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy). Fixed two
  latent defects on the way in (duplicate `Set-Cookie` collapse,
  case-sensitive merge) and added a runtime `frame_options` override on the
  Security Headers settings page. Full plan in
  [10-security-headers.md](10-security-headers.md).

## Phase 4 — Scale & polish

- **R15. Startup cost audit.** ✅ Done — schema-fingerprint marker
  (`admin_schema_markers`) skips the eight sequential store ensures on warm
  boots (~18 DDL statements → 3); staleness-guard test auto-invalidates the
  marker whenever store DDL changes. Verification also uncovered and fixed
  **B12** (lexigram-sql `DatabaseService.execute` never committed DML on
  SQLite). Full plan in [11-startup-cost.md](11-startup-cost.md).
- **R16. Request-scoped caching.** ✅ Done — short-TTL in-process
  `SessionUserCache` (default 5 s, `admin.auth.session_cache_ttl`, 0
  disables) short-circuits the per-request session→user query pair; all
  `AdminSessionService` revocation paths invalidate it, so same-process
  revocation is immediate and the TTL only bounds cross-worker staleness.
  Full plan in [12-session-user-cache.md](12-session-user-cache.md).
- **R17. Accessibility pass — DONE (2026-09-02).** B13's dead Alpine
  attributes were removed, command-palette combobox semantics and focus
  trapping were added, row ids are unique, notifications are named, result
  counts are live regions, and decorative SVGs are hidden from assistive
  technology. Full record: [13-a11y-and-dead-handlers.md](13-a11y-and-dead-handlers.md).
- **R18. Design-token/CSP correctness — DONE (2026-09-02).** The enforced
  CSP now permits the standard vendored Alpine/htmx builds to execute and
  adds `object-src`, `base-uri`, and `form-action` hardening. The existing
  UI token pipeline guards the remaining inline dynamic values; the larger
  Alpine CSP-build migration is deliberately tracked as a future breaking
  project rather than pretending the current UI is compatible. Full record:
  [14-csp-correctness.md](14-csp-correctness.md).
- **R53. First-load toast overlay layout.** ✅ **Done 2026-09-03** — the
  server-rendered `#flash-container` now shares the fixed, viewport-bounded
  overlay contract with `.toast-container`; direct toasts retain interaction
  while the empty overlay does not intercept dashboard controls. Client toast
  insertion reuses either zone, and a shell regression protects the selector
  and sizing contract. Full record in
  [51-toast-overlay-layout.md](51-toast-overlay-layout.md).
- **R54. Default saved view.** ✅ **Done 2026-09-03** — extends the R13
  per-user saved-view records with one optional default, safe star/unstar
  controls, and one-time auto-apply only for clean full-page visits. Explicit
  query state, HTMX fragments, and mutation notices remain authoritative.
  Full Plan: [52-default-saved-view.md](52-default-saved-view.md).
- **R55. Tasks test dependency closure.** ✅ **Done 2026-09-03** — the
  `lexigram-tasks` package's `test` and `all` extras and development `test`
  group now declare the existing `lexigram-resilience` test dependency, with
  workspace source and lock metadata synchronized. The production dependency
  graph remains unchanged, and the package suite collects without the former
  resilience import error. Full Plan:
  [54-tasks-test-dependency.md](54-tasks-test-dependency.md).
- **R56. Sidebar information architecture and account placement.** ✅ **Done
  2026-09-03** — the navigation manager now composes an ordered Overview →
  Workspace → Operations → Security/Integrations → Tools → Administration
  sidebar while preserving contributor groups, permissions, active state, and
  custom prefixes. Registered cluster centers are first-class Operations
  links; Settings and supplied system links remain in the utility footer;
  Profile and Sign out move to a reusable topbar UserBox variant. Direct
  user-menu callers retain the legacy full-navigation default, while rendered
  shells request the personal-only menu. Full Plan:
  [56-sidebar-information-architecture.md](56-sidebar-information-architecture.md).
- **R57. Settings control-plane audit and hardening.** ✅ **Done 2026-09-03** —
  the full `/settings` surface now has source-aware effective configuration,
  strict typed validation, honest read-only state, faithful falsy-value
  persistence, permissions/CSRF/revision/conditional-write boundaries,
  redacted audit history with rollback, and contributor-friendly spec
  derivation. YAML/environment/application-owned values are visible through a
  redacted read-only summary with source precedence, while database overrides
  retain tenant isolation and explicit ownership. The shared settings form
  preserves invalid input and accessible feedback, and HTMX saves use the
  shared dismissible toast channel. Verification: 5881 admin unit tests
  passed, 7 skipped; targeted settings/controller/UI tests passed; mypy,
  compileall, Ruff, and `git diff --check` passed. Playground/browser
  round-trip remains intentionally deferred. Full Plan:
  [57-settings-control-plane-audit.md](57-settings-control-plane-audit.md).
- **R58. Sidebar branding control and Framework menu consolidation.** ✅ **Done
  2026-09-03** — the collapse toggle now sits beside the logo/site name in the
  sidebar header and mini mode hides both branding nodes while retaining the
  accessible toggle. Cluster centers, Plugins, and privileged administration
  destinations now share one active-aware, collapsible `Framework` section;
  contributor groups, deduplication, permissions, badges, custom prefixes,
  topbar account ownership, and footer system utilities remain intact. Group
  icon/default-expansion metadata is preserved for future contributors.
  Verification: 5884 admin unit tests passed, 8 skipped; focused
  navigation/sidebar tests passed; mypy, compileall, Ruff, and
  `git diff --check` passed. Playground/browser round-trip remains
  intentionally deferred. Full Plan:
  [58-sidebar-branding-and-framework-menu.md](58-sidebar-branding-and-framework-menu.md).

## Completion status (2026-09-03)

The concrete roadmap and follow-up records through R58 are implemented and
have regression coverage. The R58 sidebar branding and Framework menu work is
complete; its browser/playground round trip remains intentionally deferred.
The R57 settings control-plane audit is complete;
its browser/playground round trip remains intentionally deferred. R14 phase 2
is implemented with its own verification record in
[53-bulk-live-progress.md](53-bulk-live-progress.md); only its playground/browser
round trip is intentionally deferred. Sidebar information architecture and
account placement are recorded in
[56-sidebar-information-architecture.md](56-sidebar-information-architecture.md),
and the settings verification record is in
[57-settings-control-plane-audit.md](57-settings-control-plane-audit.md).
The repository release gate is tracked in the [reliability audit Full Plan](50-reliability-audit.md):
targeted package suites, ruff, mypy, and the first-run scenario must remain
green before the branch is pushed. Deliberate future projects (shared/team
saved views, durable/distributed progress tasks, optional chart vendoring, and
the CSP v2 Alpine migration) are not silently marked complete; each has an
explicit note in its source plan.

## Working agreements

- Every roadmap item lands with tests and, when behavior changes,
  a paragraph in the relevant doc under `docs/`.
- Backward compatibility: additive protocol methods use duck-typed
  fallbacks (see B3's `getattr` pattern) for at least one minor version.
- Anything that touches auth/authz needs both a unit test and a live
  playground verification before merge (doc 04).
