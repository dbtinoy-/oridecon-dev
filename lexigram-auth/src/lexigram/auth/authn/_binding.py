"""JWT token binding configuration and helpers.

Provides :class:`TokenBindingConfig` and the :func:`compute_binding_hash` /
:func:`verify_binding` helpers consumed by :class:`~lexigram.auth.authn.jwt.JWTTokenManager`.

Token binding is **opt-in** and backward-compatible: tokens issued without a
``bind`` claim continue to pass verification so that callers can enable
binding incrementally without invalidating existing sessions.

class TokenBindingConfig:
    """Configuration for opt-in JWT client binding.

    When configured, a SHA-256 hash of the active binding factors is embedded
    in the ``bind`` claim of every issued token.  On verification the hash is
    re-computed from the current request context and compared against the
    stored value.  A mismatch rejects the token, preventing reuse of a stolen
    token from a different IP or device.

    Attributes:
        bind_to_ip: Include the client IP address in the binding hash.
        bind_to_fingerprint: Include an arbitrary client fingerprint string
            (e.g., the value of ``X-Client-Fingerprint``) in the hash.
        fingerprint_header: HTTP header name carrying the fingerprint value.
            Informational only — callers must extract the header value and
            pass it via the ``binding_context`` dict.
