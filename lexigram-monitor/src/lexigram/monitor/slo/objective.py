    """Defines an acceptable performance target for a monitored metric.

    An SLO specifies the maximum tolerable value for a percentile of a
    metric (e.g. ``p99 latency < 200 ms``) and the error-budget burn-rate
    threshold above which an alert should be raised.

    Attributes:
        name: Unique name for this SLO (e.g. ``"api.p99_latency"``).
        metric: Name of the metric to evaluate (e.g.
            ``"http.request.duration"``).
        percentile: Target percentile expressed as a fraction between
            0.0 and 1.0 (e.g. ``0.99`` for p99).
        threshold_ms: Maximum acceptable measured value in milliseconds.
        window: Measurement window for rolling evaluation.
        burn_rate_threshold: Fire an alert when the measured/threshold ratio
            equals or exceeds this value.  A value of ``1.0`` means "alert
            the moment the threshold is exceeded".
        description: Optional human-readable description of the SLO.
        tier: Alert routing tier. Defaults to P1_BUSINESS_HOURS.
        owner: Team or spec ID responsible for this SLO.
        runbook_url: URL pointing to the runbook for this SLO.
