      (e.g. configuration, diagnostics).
    * ``INFRASTRUCTURE`` (10) – low-level plumbing such as database connections,
      messaging clients, and cache providers.
    * ``SECURITY`` (20) – authentication/authorization infrastructure.
    * ``NORMAL`` (30) – everyday domain services with no special ordering.
    * ``APPLICATION`` (40) – application-level tools (CLI, admin utilities)
      that depend on domain services but are not themselves domain logic.
    * ``DOMAIN`` (50) – business-logic providers that may depend on earlier
      layers.
    * ``PRESENTATION`` (80) – web/API layers and other entry points.
    * ``COMMS`` (90) – outbound communication providers (email, SMS, webhooks)
      often run late to avoid interfering with core initialization.
    * ``LOW`` (100) – lowest-priority, optional providers that can boot last.
