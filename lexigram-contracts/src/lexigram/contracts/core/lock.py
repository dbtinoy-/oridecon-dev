"""Distributed Lock protocol for Lexigram Framework.

Provides the DistributedLockProtocol protocol for distributed locking across
multiple processes or services. Implementations may use Redis,
PostgreSQL advisory locks, ZooKeeper, or other coordination services.

Example::

    from lexigram.contracts.lock import DistributedLockProtocol

    async def process_with_lock(lock: DistributedLockProtocol) -> None:
        if await lock.acquire():
            try:
                # Critical section - only one process holds the lock
                await process_data()
            finally:
                await lock.release()
        else:
            logger.info("Could not acquire lock, skipping")

    # Or use as context manager
    async with lock:
        await process_data()

    """Protocol for distributed locking.

    Distributed locks coordinate access to shared resources across
    multiple processes, threads, or services. They provide:

    - Mutual exclusion: Only one holder at a time
    - Safety: Locks expire after a TTL to prevent deadlocks
    - Non-blocking acquire: Returns immediately if lock is held

    Implementations must be safe for use in async contexts and
    handle network partitions gracefully.

        lock = RedisLock(redis, "my-resource", ttl=30)
