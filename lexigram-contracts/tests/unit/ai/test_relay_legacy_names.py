"""Negative tests for obsolete relay draft API names.

The historical names ``RelayProtocol``, ``RelayConfig``, ``PassthroughData``,
and ``StreamMode`` are draft artifacts and must not be reintroduced into the
live relay package.  The unrelated event-outbox ``OutboxRelayProtocol`` is
explicitly out of scope and untouched.
