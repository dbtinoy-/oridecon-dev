"""Shorthand guard decorators for common authorization patterns.

Provides concise aliases over :func:`~lexigram.web.security.guards.use_guards`
for the most frequent use cases.

Example::

    from lexigram.web import guard, roles

    @guard(AuthGuard)
    async def protected_route(self): ...

    @roles("admin", "moderator")
    async def admin_route(self): ...

    """Concise alias for :func:`use_guards`.

    Attaches one or more guards to a route handler or controller class.
    Guards are executed in order; the first failure returns a 403 response.

    Args:
        *guard_classes: GuardProtocol classes or instances to apply.

    Returns:
        Decorator that attaches guards to the target.

    Example::

        @guard(AuthGuard)
        async def profile(self): ...

        @guard(AuthGuard, PermissionGuard("users:write"))
        async def create_user(self): ...

            from the container during application startup.
