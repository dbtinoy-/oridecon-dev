"""DI Scope Middleware for request-scoped dependency injection.

Ensures DI container is properly scoped per request to prevent
data leaks and memory issues.

This middleware:
1. Creates a child container for each request
2. Attaches it to request.state.container
3. Properly disposes of scoped resources after the request
