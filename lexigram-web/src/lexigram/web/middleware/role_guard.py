"""Role guard middleware — declarative path-to-role enforcement.

Guards HTTP paths against configured role requirements using the
authenticated identity set by the authentication middleware
(``scope["state"]["user_id"]``). Roles are resolved **per request** from the
identity store (never from JWT claims), so demotions take effect immediately.

Rules are plain values: an exact path, or a path ending in ``/**`` which
matches every path under that prefix. The first matching rule wins.

Registration order matters: this middleware must sit **inside** the
authentication middleware so an authenticated identity exists when it runs.
In :class:`~lexigram.web.di.provider.WebProvider` the auth middleware is
registered by :class:`~lexigram.web.integrations.auth.AuthIntegration`; the
role guard is registered right after it in the same step.
