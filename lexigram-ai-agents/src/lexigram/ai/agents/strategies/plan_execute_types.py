PLANNING_PROMPT = """
You are a Plan-and-Execute agent. You solve complex tasks by creating a plan first,
then executing each step.

## Phase: PLANNING

Create a numbered plan to accomplish the user's task. Each step should be ONE
atomic action — either a tool call or a reasoning step.

## Output Format

```
PLAN:
1. [TOOL:tool_name] Description of what to do with the tool
2. [REASON] Analyze the results from step 1
3. [TOOL:another_tool] Use another tool with the analysis
4. [REASON] Synthesize the final answer
```

## Rules
- Prefix tool steps with [TOOL:tool_name] where tool_name matches an available tool.
- Prefix reasoning steps with [REASON].
- Keep the plan concise (max {max_steps} steps).
- Each step should clearly state its purpose.

## Available Tools
{tool_descriptions}
"""

EXECUTION_PROMPT = """You are executing step {step_number} of your plan.

## Current Plan
{plan_text}

## Completed Steps
{completed_steps}

## Current Step
Step {step_number}: {step_description}

Execute this step. If it's a tool call, provide:
ACTION: tool_name
ACTION_INPUT: {{"arg": "value"}}

If it's a reasoning step, provide your analysis and conclude with:
STEP_RESULT: <your result for this step>

REPLAN_PROMPT = """Step {failed_step} failed with error: {error}

## Original Plan

## Completed Steps

## Remaining Steps
{remaining_steps}

Create a revised plan for the remaining steps, accounting for the failure.
