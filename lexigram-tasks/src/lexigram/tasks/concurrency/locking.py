    Maintains a mapping of *key → (expiry_timestamp, asyncio.Lock)* and
    exposes the locks via :meth:`acquire`.  Use it as an async context manager
    to prevent the same logical task from running concurrently.

    **Lock hierarchy and fallback order**

    ``LockManager`` is a *process-local* lock only.  It protects against
    concurrent execution of the same task **within a single worker process**
    but provides no cross-process or cross-host guarantees.  For distributed
    locking across multiple workers or hosts, pair this with a Redis-based or
    database-backed lock (see ``lexigram-resilience``).

    **Contention behaviour**

    * :meth:`InMemoryLock.acquire` is *non-blocking*: when the key is
      already held it returns ``False`` immediately, without suspending
      the caller. To wait for a key to become free, use
      :meth:`InMemoryLock.acquire_wait` or enter the lock with
      ``async with``.
    * The *timeout* value is enforced, not informational: an entry is
      considered expired once ``acquisition time + timeout`` has passed,
      and the next :meth:`InMemoryLock.acquire` call purges expired
      entries — freeing the key for a new acquirer even if the original
      holder never calls :meth:`InMemoryLock.release`.

    **Registration**

    Register as a container ``singleton`` so all workers within the same
    process share the same lock table::

        container.singleton(LockManager, LockManager)

    Example:
        ```python
        lock_manager = LockManager()
        async with lock_manager.acquire("user:123:sync", timeout=60):
            await sync_user_data(user_id=123)
