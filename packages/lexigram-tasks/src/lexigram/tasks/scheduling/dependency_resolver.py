"""Dependency graph management and cycle detection for the task scheduler.

Provides :class:`DependencyResolver`, which maintains a DAG of job
dependencies and raises :exc:`~lexigram.tasks.exceptions.TaskDependencyCycleError`
at registration time if adding a new job's edges would create a cycle.

This prevents runtime deadlocks caused by circular task dependencies —
jobs that mutually wait for each other will never be executed.

Typical usage::

    resolver = DependencyResolver()
    resolver.register("job-a", depends_on=["job-b"])   # OK
    resolver.register("job-b", depends_on=["job-c"])   # OK
    resolver.register("job-c", depends_on=["job-a"])   # raises TaskDependencyCycleError

    """Validates and tracks a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of job dependencies.

    Each call to :meth:`register` adds a node and its outgoing edges to the
    internal adjacency list, then runs a DFS-based cycle check.  If a cycle
    is found, :exc:`~lexigram.tasks.exceptions.TaskDependencyCycleError` is
    raised and the graph is **not** modified — keeping it permanently valid.

    The resolver is typically held by :class:`~lexigram.tasks.scheduling.scheduler.TaskScheduler`
    and consulted whenever a new job is scheduled.
