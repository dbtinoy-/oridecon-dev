"""Outbox pattern implementation for reliable event publishing.

Provides an in-memory Outbox for testing and local development.
For production with database persistence, use the OutboxEventStore
from the lexigram-events extension.

The Outbox pattern ensures events are stored in the same transaction
as business data, then relayed asynchronously for publishing.

Example::

    from lexigram.memory import InMemoryOutbox, OutboxRelay
    from lexigram.memory import InMemoryEventBus

    # Create components
    event_bus = InMemoryEventBus()
    outbox = InMemoryOutbox()
    relay = OutboxRelay(outbox, event_bus)

    # In your service (same transaction as business data)
    async with uow:
        user = User(id="123", name="Alice")
        uow.register_new(user)
        outbox.store_event(UserCreated(user_id=user.user_id))
        await uow.commit()

    # Relay processes events asynchronously
    await relay.process_pending()
