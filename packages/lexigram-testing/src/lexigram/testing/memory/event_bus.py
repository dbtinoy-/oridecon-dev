"""In-memory event bus implementation for development and testing.

Provides a lightweight publish/subscribe event bus with support for
handler priorities, middleware chains, and configurable error handling.
Handlers are executed sequentially in priority order (lower value = runs
first). When ``on_handler_error`` is provided, individual handler
exceptions are caught and reported rather than aborting remaining handlers.
