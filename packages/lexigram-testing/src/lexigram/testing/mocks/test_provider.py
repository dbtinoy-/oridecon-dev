"""Lifecycle-tracking test provider for verifying container boot sequences.

Unlike :class:`~lexigram.testing.mocks.base.MockProvider` (which provides a
mock base for real providers), ``TestProvider`` is a pure no-op provider
whose sole purpose is to record which lifecycle methods were invoked.

Example::

    provider = TestProvider(name="my_svc")
    await container.register(provider)
    assert provider.register_called
    assert not provider.boot_called
