"""Regression tests: DatabaseService.execute must COMMIT mutations.

Before the fix, ``DatabaseService.execute`` delegated every statement to
``execute_query`` (the SELECT path — cursor fetch, no commit). On SQLite
that left INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE inside an open implicit transaction that
was silently rolled back when the connection closed, unless a later
statement on the same connection happened to commit. Data written via
``service.execute`` could vanish on clean shutdown.

These tests boot a real SQLite-backed DatabaseService against a temp
file, write through ``execute``, shut the service down, and verify the
data with a fresh raw connection.
