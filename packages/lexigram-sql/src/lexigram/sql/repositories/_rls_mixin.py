"""Row-level security mixin for ``SQLRepository``.

Intercepts ``_apply_rls_to_query`` calls from ``_ReadMixin`` and
``_WriteMixin`` to inject the active scope predicate produced by
``RowLevelSecurityPolicy``.

The mixin is **pure query manipulation** — it does not touch the database
or manage context-var state.  State management lives in
:mod:`lexigram.sql.row_level_security`.
