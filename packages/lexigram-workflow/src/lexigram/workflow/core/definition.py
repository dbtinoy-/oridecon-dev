"""Workflow definition — versioned descriptor for a workflow graph.

A :class:`WorkflowDefinition` is an immutable, named, versioned descriptor
that describes the shape of a workflow.  The ``version`` field must be
incremented whenever the definition structure changes in a way that would be
incompatible with already-running instances.

Example::

    from lexigram.workflow.core.definition import WorkflowDefinition

    defn = WorkflowDefinition(name="onboarding", steps=[], version=2)

    Args:

        steps: Ordered list of step descriptors (opaque; interpreted by the
            executor).  Defaults to an empty list for graph-based workflows
            where nodes/edges are the canonical step representation.
        version: Definition schema version.  Increment this whenever the
            definition structure changes incompatibly.  Defaults to ``1``.
