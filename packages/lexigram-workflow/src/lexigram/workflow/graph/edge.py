    """A directed edge in the workflow graph.

    Edges connect a *source* node to a *target* node.  An optional
    *condition* callable gates the edge: if provided, the edge is
    traversed only when ``condition(state)`` is truthy.  Edges without
    a condition are always traversed (unconditional/always edges).

    For parallel branches, list multiple edges from the same source nodes;
    :class:`~lexigram.workflow.graph.engine.WorkflowEngine` will
    collect all edges whose conditions are satisfied and execute them
    concurrently when ``GraphConfig.parallel_branches`` is ``True``.

    Attributes:
        source: Name of the originating node.
        target: Name of the destination node.
        condition: Optional callable ``(state: dict) -> bool``.
            When ``None`` the edge is unconditional.
        label: Optional human-readable label for documentation/debugging.
        is_parallel: Hint that this edge should be executed concurrently
            with sibling edges from the same source.  The engine enables
            parallelism automatically when multiple conditions are satisfied;
            this flag provides an explicit override.
