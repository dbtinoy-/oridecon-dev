"""Bounded, TTL-respecting cache for the :func:`idempotent` decorator.

Replaces the former module-level ``_idempotency_cache`` dict: every
decorated function gets its own instance (no process-wide shared state),
entries expire after their TTL (time-sourced from the ambient clock so
tests can drive expiry with :class:`lexigram.testing.clock.FixedClock`),
and the cache is size-bounded, evicting least-recently-used entries once
``max_size`` is reached — expired entries first, mirroring
``MemoryStateStore`` in ``lexigram-cache``.
