"""Tests for concurrent resolution of scoped services within one Scope.

The container guarantees "same instance within this scope".  That guarantee
must hold even when two tasks resolve the same scoped service concurrently
while its (async) factory is still running — otherwise a request that does
``asyncio.gather(... )`` can hand two components two different "scoped"
instances (e.g. two DB sessions for one request).
