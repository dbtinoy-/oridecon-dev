"""Async reader-writer lock for Lexigram Framework.

Provides ``AsyncRWLock`` — an asyncio-native, readers-writer lock that
allows many concurrent readers OR exactly one writer.  Ideal for
protecting state shared across many async tasks where reads vastly
outnumber writes.

class AsyncRWLock:
    """Asyncio reader-writer lock (many readers, one writer).

    Readers may enter concurrently as long as no writer is active.
    A writer blocks until all active readers have exited and then
    acquires exclusive access.

    Use the async context managers :meth:`read` and :meth:`write`
    to bracket read/write critical sections.

    Example::

        rw = AsyncRWLock()

        async def do_read():
            async with rw.read():
                data = shared_data.copy()

        async def do_write(item):
            async with rw.write():
                shared_data.append(item)

    .. note::
        Writers are not prioritised over readers in this implementation.
        Under sustained read load a writer may starve. If writer latency
        is critical, use an external library with write-priority support.
