"""Domain events for lexigram core security.

Emitted when security events occur (threats, secret rotation, guard denials).
Consumed by audit, monitoring, and security review systems.

Note: ``CsrfViolationEvent`` is defined here for completeness but CSRF
is HTTP-specific; that event is most useful from ``lexigram-web``.
