"""Inbound relay authentication contracts.

The gateway itself never validates keys: a host binds a
``RelayAuthVerifierProtocol`` implementation (e.g. the lexigram-auth
adapter) through the container, and the gateway only calls it.  When no
verifier is bound the gateway stays open by default (``require_auth``
is opt-in at the config level).
