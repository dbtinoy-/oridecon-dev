"""Persistent distributed lock store protocol.

Provides advisory, TTL-based distributed locks backed by a persistent store
(SQL advisory locks, a SQL ``locks`` table, Redis, etc.), allowing multiple
services to coordinate exclusive access to shared resources.

Implementations ship in ``lexigram-sql`` (``lexigram.sql.stores``) so they can
share the application's database connection pool without creating a lateral
cross-extension dependency.

Example::

    from lexigram.contracts.core.stores import LockStoreProtocol

    store = await container.resolve(LockStoreProtocol)
    acquired = await store.acquire("billing_job", owner=instance_id, ttl=60)
    if acquired:
        try:
            ...
        finally:
            await store.release("billing_job", owner=instance_id)
