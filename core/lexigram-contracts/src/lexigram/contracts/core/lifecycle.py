          twice MUST NOT produce side effects or raise.
        - Implementers SHOULD complete quickly — blocking here delays

        - ``shutdown()`` SHOULD complete within a reasonable timeout.

    Services that hold configuration-derived state (e.g., connection pools,

    config changes without requiring a full restart.

    Behavioral Contract:
        - ``on_config_reload`` MUST be idempotent.
        - ``on_config_reload`` SHOULD complete quickly; defer heavy work to a background task.
        - ``on_config_reload`` MUST NOT raise exceptions; log and absorb errors.
