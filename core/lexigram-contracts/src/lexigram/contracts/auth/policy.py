"""Policy-store protocol for the ABAC policy engine.

Defines :class:`PolicyStoreProtocol`, the contract for loading, persisting, and
querying ABAC policies.  Multiple back-ends (in-memory, YAML file,
database, remote service) can satisfy this protocol through structural
subtyping, making the :class:`PolicyEngine` independently testable.
