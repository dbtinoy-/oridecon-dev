"""Task queue error types.

These are the expected, recoverable failure types that task queue operations
can return as ``Err`` values inside ``Result[…, TaskQueueError]``.

Infrastructure failures (broker connection lost, authentication broken)
must still be raised as exceptions — do not wrap them in ``Result``.
