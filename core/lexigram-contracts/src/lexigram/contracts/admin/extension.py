"""Base classes for admin extensions.

Defines the Extension ABC and ExtensionConfig so that third-party packages
can implement admin extensions without depending on lexigram-admin.

Note: As of Phase 2e (2026-03), these types have been moved to lexigram-admin.types.
This module is retained for backward compatibility and contains only protocol-level
configurations if needed. Extension implementations should import from lexigram.admin.types.
