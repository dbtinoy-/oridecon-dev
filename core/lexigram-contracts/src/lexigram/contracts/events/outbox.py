"""Outbox pattern protocols for reliable event publishing.

Defines the contracts that both in-memory (core) and database-backed
(lexigram-sql / lexigram-messaging) outbox implementations must satisfy.

The Outbox pattern stores domain events in the same transaction as
business data, then relays them asynchronously to the event bus,
guaranteeing at-least-once delivery.
