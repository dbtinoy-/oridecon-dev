"""Migration runner protocol.

Defines the contract for database migration execution so that ``lexigram-cli``
and other consumers can resolve a runner from the container without importing
``lexigram-sql`` directly.

Concrete implementations (Alembic adapter, ``SimpleMigrationManager``, etc.)
live in ``lexigram-sql`` and are registered by ``DatabaseProvider`` at boot time.

Example::

    from lexigram.contracts.data.sql.migrations import MigrationRunnerProtocol

    runner = await container.resolve(MigrationRunnerProtocol)
    await runner.run_migrations()

    """Executes database migrations in the correct order.

    Implementations must be idempotent: running ``run_migrations()`` on an
    already up-to-date schema must be a no-op.  Each migration is identified
    by a unique string version identifier (e.g. ``"20240101_001"`` or the
    Alembic revision hash).

    Typical usage::

        runner = await container.resolve(MigrationRunnerProtocol)
        result = await runner.run_migrations()
        if result:
            logger.info("migrations_applied", count=len(result))
