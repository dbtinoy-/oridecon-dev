class ScopedMiddleware:
    """Middleware that creates a fresh DI scope for each invocation.

    A new child scope is opened before the downstream handler is called and
    automatically disposed when the handler returns (or raises).  The active
    scope is attached to the context as ``_scope`` so that nested resolvers
    can use it for request-scoped dependency resolution.

    The ``container`` argument **must** satisfy the container protocol from
    :mod:`oridecon.contracts.core.di` — specifically it must expose an
    async ``scope()`` context manager that yields a child
    :class:`~oridecon.contracts.core.di.ContainerResolverProtocol`.  Passing a
    plain object that does not implement ``scope()`` will raise
    :exc:`AttributeError` at call time.

    Use :class:`~oridecon.di.container.Container` (from the ``oridecon``
    package) as the canonical implementation.  Never pass the container itself
    into business-logic services resolved within the scope — use constructor
    injection instead.

    Args:
        container: A DI container that implements the ``scope()`` async
            context-manager protocol (see
            :class:`~oridecon.contracts.core.di.ContainerRegistrarProtocol`).

    Example:
        ```python
        from oridecon.middleware import ScopedMiddleware
        from oridecon.middleware.core.chain import MiddlewareChain

        chain = MiddlewareChain([ScopedMiddleware(container)])
        result = await chain.execute(context, handler)
        ```
