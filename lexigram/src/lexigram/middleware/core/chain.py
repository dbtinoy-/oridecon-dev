"""Mutable middleware builder that produces an immutable MiddlewarePipeline.

MiddlewareChain is the *mutable* counterpart to the immutable
:class:`~lexigram.app.pipeline.MiddlewarePipeline`.  Use it when
you need to build a pipeline incrementally (e.g. across multiple provider
``boot`` calls) and only freeze it once construction is complete.

Example::

    from lexigram.middleware.core.chain import MiddlewareChain
    from lexigram.middleware.builtins import LoggingMiddleware, TimingMiddleware

    chain = MiddlewareChain()
    chain.add(TimingMiddleware())
    chain.add(LoggingMiddleware())

    pipeline = chain.build()          # immutable from here on
    result = await pipeline.execute(ctx, handler)

    The chain itself is never executed — it is only a construction helper.
    After :meth:`build` is called the chain remains mutable; further :meth:`add`
