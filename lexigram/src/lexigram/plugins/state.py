"""Boot-readable file mirror of admin-toggled plugin disabled state.

Bridges "admin clicked disable" to "next process boot excludes it" without
core ever gaining a DB dependency — this module has zero knowledge of
``TenantConfigStore`` or any other admin/DB concept, deliberately, per the
package-boundary rule (extensions never depend on each other).

Persistence contract (systemd-preset style):
  - Every save is atomic: tempfile + fsync + ``os.replace``. A crash leaves
    either the old or the new file, never a torn one.
  - Read-modify-write is serialized with a ``flock`` advisory lock so
    concurrent admin sessions in different processes cannot clobber each
    other's update.
  - A corrupt state file is renamed to ``<name>.corrupt-<ts>`` and reading
    fails open to an empty set — plugin state must never block boot.

Note:
    File integrity: ``plugins.json`` is treated as operator-owned and is
    intentionally *not* tamper-evident (no signature/HMAC). Write access to
    the file already implies full filesystem trust, and its ``disabled``
    entries are only membership-tested against discovered entry points, so
    the file cannot be used to inject code. This acceptance is deliberate —
    see ``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-security-plugins-design.md``.
