"""Application lifecycle events published through the EventBusProtocol.

These events allow plugins, middleware, and application code to hook
into the application lifecycle without coupling to the ``Application``
class directly.

Example::

    from lexigram.app.events import ApplicationStarted
    from lexigram.logging import get_logger

    logger = get_logger(__name__)

    async def on_started(event: ApplicationStarted) -> None:
        logger.info(
            "application_started",
            app_name=event.app_name,
        )

    bus.subscribe(ApplicationStarted, on_started)
