"""DI-level interceptor utilities.

This module provides a simple interceptor protocol, a registry for
managing interceptors, and proxy logic that can wrap any object so that
method calls are dispatched through the interceptor chain.  The core
``Container`` is updated to consult the registry when resolving services
and will automatically proxy instances that have interceptors registered.

The design is deliberately lightweight and has no dependency on the
web-specific interceptor protocols; those live in
``lexigram-web/src/lexigram/web/protocols.py``.  This module is intended to
be usable by *any* extension package that wants to intercept service
calls.
